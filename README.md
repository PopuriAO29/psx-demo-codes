Playstation Demo Code Collection
================================

This collection contains most of the cheat codes I hacked for Playstation 1
demos.

Many of them are for the demos included in the German/European edition of the
[Official Playstation Magazine (OPM)]. The code descriptions are mainly in
German and the codes themselves were made with/for the [Xploder] cheat device.
